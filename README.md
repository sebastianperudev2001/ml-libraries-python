# Machine Learning frameworks in Python

1. **TensorFlow**: Developed by Google Brain, TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework widely used for both research and production purposes. It provides comprehensive support for deep learning and neural networks.

2. **PyTorch**: Developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR), PyTorch is another popular open-source machine learning library known for its dynamic computation graph and ease of use. It's widely used in research and also gaining traction in production environments.

3. **scikit-learn**: scikit-learn is a simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis, built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis and is widely used for classical machine learning algorithms like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

4. **Keras**: Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python. It's designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks and runs on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK). Keras provides a high-level API for building and training neural networks.

5. **XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost**: These are gradient boosting libraries that are highly efficient and widely used for structured/tabular data. They often outperform other algorithms in Kaggle competitions and are widely used in industry for tasks like regression, classification, and ranking.

6. **MXNet**: Developed by Apache Software Foundation, MXNet is a flexible and efficient deep learning library with APIs available in multiple programming languages. It's known for its scalability and performance.

7. **Hugging Face Transformers**: This library provides state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) architectures (like BERT, GPT, etc.) and pretrained models. It's widely used for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more.

8. **CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit)**: Developed by Microsoft, CNTK is an open-source deep learning toolkit for commercial-grade distributed deep learning. It offers efficient implementations of several algorithms and is known for its scalability across multiple GPUs and servers.

9. **Spark MLlib**: MLlib is Apache Spark's scalable machine learning library. It provides scalable implementations of many common machine learning algorithms and tools for feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and more.

10. **Fastai**: Fastai is a high-level deep learning library built on top of PyTorch. It aims to make deep learning more accessible through high-level abstractions and best practices.
