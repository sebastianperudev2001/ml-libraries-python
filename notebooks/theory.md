## Module 1: Machine Learning Fundamentals

### Basic definitions

**Artificial Intelligence**: Effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.

- In the past it was predifined set of rules
- AI can be simple or complex

**Machine Lerning**: Figureing out the rules for us. Take the data and determines the data.

- Goal: Highest accuracy possible

**Neural Networks**: A form of ML that uses a layered representation of data.

- 2 layers: Input and output --> IN regular programs
- In Deep Learning, we have several layers, input, N in between layers and output.
- Our data is going to be procced in different layers and connections between nodes.
- Multi state information extraction process
- The data will change when passing the different layers

**Data**:
